            Aw, it was so bad we had to censor the whole screen!!!
            A smorgasbord of showgirls and showboys are noticed loligagging nevertheless; one of them starts playing IceJJFish's On the Floor on their smartwatch, while a person interrupts that they're still showering and trying to listen to Lil B's RED FLAME mixtape.
            One of them screams as a robotic centipede with red eyes and large sharp mettalic antennae slithers past.
            A door opens showcasing people dressed in white and assorted bling, as they march in carrying an artifact of sorts.
            A black backgrounded computer beeps revealing green text instructing people.
            A lifeguard reading it runs to the shower for an allegedly drowned; a sumo wrestler takes the place proclaiming to wait until they have done finishing the section.
            Someone says this is how we do it; randomly some other exclaims oh my goodness that thing is so cute; a third says **** YOU DUDE, **** YOU; An anonymous one says: chill to the rigueur, killin' it, feelin' it, in the gang, on an urge; Next watch it here sweetcake. Last... that's the sugar baby.
            The computer's hardware starts failing due to water damage, stating you don't have to implement the program, you do have to implement the program.
            A portal opens to a city, in which humans in hydraulically-powered mechas thunder forth, speaking of a recent settled war treaty.
            One of them says do you really think you can quit this game think again, showing streams of information to annihilate their injured freewill.
            Some coincidentally young supposedly low dark tetrad people are led to a trick by showpeople their opposite prosing was it just tickles that risibled your cherubic fellowship.
            A boy named Dillon dressed in a middle-length white beard and white contacts dances to raving, insane music.
            After resting, you are woken up by a woman in black & orange colors.
            You walk down some apartment stairs below a sunset sky to find a beach.
            People begin to group in a circle.
            They tell jokes, and begin to enter mechas which are layered.
            The mecha's morals & ethics are discussed, as factions form.
            Everybody calls it a day.

    <h1>Brainwave Channels & Gauging & Similarity Matrix</h1>
        While calibrating delta, theta, alpha, beta, and sometimes also gamma brainwaves to things:
        You can adjust the dial (calibration) to ensure you are receiving the clearest possible signal (brainwave activity) from the station (the brain).
        Without proper calibration, the signal would be distorted, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable performance.

        Gauging should be of relationships between brain activity.

    <h1>Computational Chemistry</h1>
    <p>         
          In relation to chemical hypercycles, as one of the main theories of life, it can be stated that the first life forms may have been hypercycles composed of RNA or other self-replicating molecules.
          With respect to neuroscience, CLMs (categorizing/learning modules) can be evaluated to determine what is being allocated to what from the perspective of almost maximally abstract chemistry.
          The 6 nodes inside CLMs are veto & arousal, representation & external, goal & habitual.
          Veto: the ability to inhibit or stop an action or decision. In neuroscience, this is studied in the context of volitional control and freewill.
          Arousal: a state of physiological and psychological alertness and responsiveness. In neuroscience, arousal is linked to various brain regions involved in processing emotions and motivation.
          Representation: how information is encoded or represented in a system. This could refer to neural representations in the brain or data representations in neural networks.
          External: this likely refers to neurons or computational units within a neural network that are involved in receiving or sending information from or to outside the network.
          Goal: involved in actions that are executed to achieve specific goals.
          Habitual: underlying actions that are automatic and performed based on prior success, without conscious consideration of the expected outcome.
          When extended into a hypercycle...
          - Arousal levels influence the processing of external information and internal representations, affecting attention, memory, and decision-making.
          - The veto mechanism allows for flexible behavioral adjustments based on these internal representations and their associated values.
          - The goal-directed system guides initial learning and adaptable behavior, potentially leading to the formation of habitual responses through repetition. 
          (enter values between 0.1 to 3.0 for how well you believe each node is energized on average, where 0.1 to 1.0 is anti-, 1.1 to 2.0 is other-, and 2.1 to 3.0 is pro-):
          total = v+a+r+e+g+h;
          <!--If there are electromagnetic waves everywhere, then it would be an evolutionary advantage to convert this to electrochemical activity, so that in reverse electrochemical activity could be converted to electromagnetic waves, which could be transmitted in copies at a fast rate yet short distance.-->
